# Neural-Network-Pruning
In this age of deep learning , neural nets with large number neurons and parameters are very common . But , a rule of thumb for obtaining good generalisation is to make sure that we build the smallest system that fits the data. It is essential to prune the network for making it more efficient. In this paper we discuss about one such pruning technique that we learned from a previous paper that is based on the angles between the unit vectors of the hidden layer which are similar or complementary towards the output. Initially we build a simple three layer network to classify different emotions of faces and then compare the results after applying the technique and see how it affects our neural network.
